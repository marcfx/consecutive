# Consecutive sorter

Console application that processes large files (tested on 20GB) with  UInt32 numers separated by space. 
It provides list of consecutive number groups to the console output or into the file.

## Usage

Process input file and generate output file

`Consecutive.Console.exe -i InputFileName.txt -o OutputFileName.txt -a (algorithm:BitMask|InMemorySimple|ExternalMergeSort)`

### Generate sample file

Generate sample file and process it

`Consecutive.Console.exe -s Sample.txt -x 1000000 -i Sample.txt -o Output.txt`

## Algorithms
### InMemorySimple

Very fast, but requires lot of memory. For 1.0000.000 (100MB input file) requires 1.5GB of RAM.
*Do not use on big files!*

### BitMask

Always take some time (2 minutes), but requires at most 500MB of RAM.

- Test: 10.7GB took 17 minutes.

### External Merge Sort
Very low memory consumption (up to 100MB), but it requires heavy disk activity. Uses [external merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting) algorithm.

- Test: 10.7GB took 50 minutes.
